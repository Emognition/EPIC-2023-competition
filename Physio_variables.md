The physiological variables in this study include:

1. Photoplethysmography (PPG) Rate: measuring blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue.
2. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Rate and Quality: assessing the electrical activity of the heart.
3. Electrodermal Activity (EDA) variables, including Clean, Tonic, Phasic, Skin Conductance Responses (SCR) Onsets, Peaks, Height, and Amplitude: evaluating the changes in skin conductance due to sweat gland activity.
4. Respiration (RSP) variables, such as Amplitude, Rate, Respiratory Variation Time (RVT), Phase, Phase Completion, and Symmetry (PeakTrough and RiseDecay): capturing the characteristics of breathing patterns.
5. Corrugator EMG variables, including Clean, Amplitude, Activity, Onsets, and Offsets: monitoring the activity of the corrugator supercilii muscle, which is involved in frowning.
6. Trapezius EMG variables, such as Clean, Amplitude, Activity, Onsets, and Offsets: measuring the activity of the trapezius muscle, located in the upper back and neck.
7. Zygomaticus EMG variables, including Clean, Amplitude, Activity, Onsets, and Offsets: observing the activity of the zygomaticus major muscle, which is involved in smiling.
8. Skin Temperature (skt): assessing the peripheral temperature of the skin.
9. Subject Number (sub_num) and Video Number (vid_num): identifiers for each participant and the video stimulus used in the study.
