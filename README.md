# FEDformer Solution for EPiC 2023

The solution for all 4 scenarios of EPiC 2023.

Utilized the FEDformer model to generate sequence level predictions. The model used in this project is modified version of FEDfomer with Wavelet Encoder and Fourier Decoder. 
The file level predictions will be processed and generated by a smooth model.

## Results
Overall RMSE for all scenarios: **1.57**

## Run the Experiemnt
1. Change the parameter inside `./scripts/run_EPiC.sh`.
2. Run the shell scirpt to reproduce the result
    ```bash
    bash ./scripts/run_EPiC.sh
   ```
3. `run.py` will train the model and save checkpoints
4. `extracted_output.py` will extract the sequence level outputs from the trained model
5. `smooth.py` will get both the smoothed and unsmoothed file level predictions.
6. The final submitted results could be found at `./smooth_pred`
