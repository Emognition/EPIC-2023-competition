    "This code processes the Emognition 2023 challenge data by down-sampling the annotation files for each scenario and fold, and saves the down-sampled data as new CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "specifically:\n",
    "  - Sets the base_folder_path to the path where the Emognition 2023 challenge data is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Defines a dictionary scenario_folds that maps scenario numbers to the number of folds for each scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Loops through the scenario numbers (1 to 4) and sets the scenario_folder variable accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Within the loop, it iterates through the folds based on the number of folds for the current scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Depending on the number of folds for the current scenario, it sets the paths for the training and testing data folders, particularly the train_annotations_folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Loops through the files in the train_annotations_folder, looking for CSV files that don't have \"resampled\" in their file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For each CSV file found, it reads the data into a pandas DataFrame, down-samples the data by taking every 20th row, and saves the down-sampled data to a new CSV file with the suffix \"_resampled_1hz.csv\".\n"
